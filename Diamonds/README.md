# Diamonds <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/diamonds.png" width="30"/>

The goal is simple, provided a letter you display a "diamond" made of each letter between 'A' and the given letter.

## Example for letter 'G'

```
      A
     B B
    C   C
   D     D
  E       E
 F         F
G           G
 F         F
  E       E
   D     D
    C   C
     B B
      A
```
      

## How I did it

I took different approaches:

- [Naive](https://github.com/Naxyoh/Kata/tree/master/Diamonds/NaiveApproach):
Just do it however you want, however you can

- [Functionnal](https://github.com/Naxyoh/Kata/tree/master/Diamonds/FunctionnalApproach):
No more variables, no more modifying arrays, only functions.
