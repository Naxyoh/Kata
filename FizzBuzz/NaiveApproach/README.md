This might be the most popular kata in the programming world when talking about TDD and baby steps.

It is a game of counting in which you replace all multpiles of "3" with "Fizz", all multiples of "5" with "Buzz" and all multiples of "3" and "5" with "FizzBuzz".

### Example if you count to 15

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
```
