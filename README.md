List of different katas I did

### [Diamonds](https://github.com/Naxyoh/Kata/tree/master/Diamonds) <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/diamonds.png" width="30"/>

The goal is simple, provided a letter you display a "diamond" made of each letter between 'A' and the given letter.

### [FizzBuzz](https://github.com/Naxyoh/Kata/tree/master/FizzBuzz) <img src="https://cdn3.iconfinder.com/data/icons/letters-and-numbers-1/32/number_123-512.png" width="40"/>

It is a game of counting in which you replace all multiples of "3" with "Fizz", all multiples of "5" with "Buzz" and all multiples of "3" and "5" with "FizzBuzz".
